# 🧬 MolFusion-BBB 

**MolFusion-BBB** is a molecular property prediction model based on the **gMLP** architecture.


MolFusion integrates **three complementary molecular representations**:

1. **SCAGE embedding**
2. **MolE embedding**
3. **RDKit descriptors**

These representations are concatenated and fed into a gated MLP to predict blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP).
